They feel completely disjointed from the structure of the program as it is unclear how to make the most of 1.5 hours of lab, when I've only had the class a few hours before, haven't even read the material, much less understand it, in a way where I can ask productive questions that can help me.

I do also think most of the exams were pretty fair, but like I mentioned, they do require a significant amount of self studying outside of lecture time a lot of time because a lot of they covered was not really mentioned in class or even examples of it given to us. I think 511’s quiz felt longer than it should have really been since there was a lot of coding questions and in a strict time limit. I also felt like it was a bit unrealistic to expect us to finish it in 50 minutes. With 523s quiz I felt like it was easier to finish because we were usually given data set that we could test on, as well as blanks for our code.

I do think it would be nice if we were given more information about what to expect or even how many questions to expect would be helpful. Only one instructor told us how many questions would be on the quiz as well as how many questions would be for each lecture that they covered. I do think that a cheat sheet as well is helpful in preparing to study, but I also feel like in an exam situation, especially under time constraints just having to switch back-and-forth between the tabs that you are working in and where you cheatsheet is located can be detrimental to you.

But I just hope we could make the scope more clear. Many lab questions need to look up for external resource. And by given the amount of workload, I don't have enough time to go through the lecture notes carefully.

I do like the iclicker questions during the lecture time for 523, that's always interesting and help learning. And for 521, it's hard to follow during the lecture time. I hope we could have more structured examples, and step by step instructions. I like 551 the most. It always follows the lecture notes and covers the content, very organized and clear. Thanks!",Dissatisfied,"I think overall it's well designed and can help us learn. But just like I mentioned above, some lab questions need us to look for external resource, I hope the scope could be more clear. I also have another two points that would like to share. First is about our lab schedule, I hope we could have the lab for the lectures on the same day. For example if I have 511 and 523 on Monday, it makes sense to have 511 lab on Monday as well. But when I have 521 and 551 on Tuesday, the lab is for 523, which makes me feel irrelevant to what I learnt during the day. I feel more comfortable to have the lab for the lecture on the same day. Another thing is about the hand written cheatsheet. I feel we are all adults, even though we came here might have different learning goals, but we know what we're doing. While reviewing the lecture notes and preparing the cheatsheet, it already helps me learning. It takes me too much time to write the cheatsheet in hand, and I feel it's even waste the time, cause I could use that time to do more reading and understanding, rather than focus on submit it on time. Thanks!",Satisfied,"I think our instructors are very supportive, thanks so much! I just hope we could have less mistakes during the lectures and in the lab assignments. For 521, I hope we could have more organized and step by step instructions, sometimes it's hard to follow.

Not until lab2's due past did I realize that we will get points deducted because lab1 grade was released after that. And I talked to a few persons they were in the same situations as me.

I think the pace is reasonable. ,Satisfied,I appreciate the feedback provided by the instructors and course coordinators on slack when questions or concerns are brought up.,Moderately Challenging,,Sometimes Overwhelming,"I find myself working till 10pm at night to complete one lab a day (the pace that I set for myself). Not really any feedback, but just providing a data point for the student reps / instructors.",I enjoy the structured learning environment alongside the pressure to learn things quickly.,Maybe its just the start of the program but I still don't have a good understanding of when grades get released.,
9/24/2024 19:41:54,Dissatisfied,"I think the use of autograders defeats the purpose of writing code. Code is highly individual, and people write it in many different ways, but the autograder only checks for specific cases. Someone may have added extra functionality to their code, but they could still fail the autograder test",Very satisfied,,Satisfied,,Satisfied,,Extremely Challenging,"I think the questions for 551 are extremely challenging compared to the course curriculum, and given the limited time we have to complete everything, there should possibly be a change in the lab design or deadlines.",Sometimes Overwhelming,,"1. Well effective communication
2. Strict deadlines
3. Helpful instructors and TA's",,
9/24/2024 20:09:11,Neutral,"the grading is too slow. With slow feedback we could make the same mistakes again in the next lab. 
and it is also too strict. I feel like it is not checking whether I properly apply what I learned but those unnecessary details. 
for example, sometimes questions require you to “explore” stuff but did not specify what reasoning or steps you need to provide. then point’s get docked for not being detailed enough. ",Very satisfied,,Satisfied,,Satisfied,,Moderately Challenging,,Mostly Manageable,,,,

9/24/2024 22:02:59,Neutral,"It is intense, as well as too much self-learning. Hopefully there could be more lecturing instead of starting the class by iclicker questions asking what has not been taught yet. ",Neutral,"week 3 is too overwelming, labs , quizzes, worksheets, lectures all happening at the same time",Neutral,"To be frank, some instructor seems to need more teaching practice before teaching graduate students. An instructor should know what the students are expecting from him, rather than just simply demonstrating. The course contents need to be explained more clearly and with more coherent elaboration too. ",Satisfied,"So far so good, but eamils would be more formal and clearer than slack for important notices.",Extremely Challenging,"schedule too tight, not enough time to walk through the course materials and self-reflection",Frequently Overwhelming,lighter workload please,"The academic coordinating team is honestly open to feedback and concerns, love you guys for this!",big leap between what is covered at class and lab questions,if possible reset the sections for each block so we can know our peers!
