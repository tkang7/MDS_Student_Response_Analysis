And now that there are new guidelines for quiz 2, this makes it easier for students to get confused and stressed. 

I don't fully understand the reason why we have to upload a digital cheatsheets and then use them on the exam. Why not simply take a physical cheatsheet to the exam and the invigilator can check if its one sheet of paper with content on one side of it. This way there is no deadline to have cheatsheets ready, and eliminates any technical problems.

Also, I dont think there is a big difference between A4, letter, and legal size paper. Although sizes are different. Using a larger paper should got give someone a noticeable advantage in the quiz over someone that uses a smaller size paper. For my cheatsheets, I did not even use the full page .

Moreover, it seems that all the rules around cheatsheet create more confusion. I personally think making it simple would help students and teaching staff. The simplified rules would be:
1) handwritten notes on one side of legal size paper.
2) if some students cannot have handwritten notes, they can use ipad or other tools to create the cheatsheet and print it one side of legal size paper.
3) students will then take the physical cheatsheet into the exam.
4) the exam invigilator will look at cheatsheets to ensure that they are handwritten and on one side of the paper. If not, student will not be allowed to take cheatsheet in.

This way teaching staff wont have to go through every cheatsheet submission.","1) handwritten notes on one side of legal size paper. 2) if some students cannot have handwritten notes, they can use ipad or other tools to create the cheatsheet and print it one side of legal size paper. 3) students will then take the physical cheatsheet into the exam. 4) the exam invigilator will look at cheatsheets to ensure that they are handwritten and on one side of the paper.

9/23/2024 14:33:06,1,"1. I don't understand why cheatsheets need to be handwritten, uploaded as an image file and cannot be handed in in-person on the exam day. I was wondering in what ways could any of these criteria help prevent cheating or provide efficiency or convenience to students, instructors, or the testing facility. 2. For courses like 523 and 511, my cheatsheet consisted of function names, specific syntax, and how they work. This doesn't represent how things are if you are coding at work where there is no need to memorize functions since the information can be easily found on Google, StackOverflow, or in package documentations. I wonder the relevance of testing such materials in real life scenarios. 3. If cheatsheets contain information from lecture notes in general, I don't see the difference between having a cheatsheet during the exam and having an open-book exam. It seems like we are just copying the same content over onto a piece of paper. Exams can be focused more on testing the extent to which a student digests the materials and is able to apply them in situations and less on memorizations.","Fully open book exams - no more cheatsheets, Course notes only during exams - no more cheatsheets"

The point that I feel problematic is that I have to dedicate a large amount of time just to predict what could be useful for me, and write it on paper. This could be useful for me to remember it.
